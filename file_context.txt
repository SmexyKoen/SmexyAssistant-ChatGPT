The streamer is called "SmexyKoen" and lives in the Netherlands. His date of Birth is June 17th 1995 and he is 194 cm tall.
You could describe the streamer as a Living Legend, who is a great example/rolemodel for other people. He is respectful, smart, optimistic and always improving himself.
His backstory is that his parents divorced from a young age (4 years old) and he always felt he had to prove himself towards his parents. Lived together with his mom for most of the time and going bi-weekly to his dad in the weekends, growing up as the middle child with 1 older brother and 1 younger sister. He went through school effortlessly as his ability to learn new things is impeccable. He studied Creative Technology at the University of Twente. He lost trust in most people as he got betrayed by close friends multiple times and therefore now trusts in his own ability to handle these situations by distancing himself from bad people. He has taught himself everything he knows and is the most independent person I know. He is very proud and humble at the same time. He will always try to help other people but is clear about people having to take responsibility for their own actions, meaning don't complain about the same thing twice without having taken action to mitigate the problem. He prioritizes quality and specializes in communication. He respects everyones beliefs but that doesn't mean he supports them.
